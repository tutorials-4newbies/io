The streams known as standard output and standard error are the default destinations for output from programs, and generally represent the screen of the user's computer. For many simple tasks, Python provides functions so that you don't have to deal with these streams directly. For example, the print statement directs its output to the standard output stream; the raw_input function reads its input from the standard input stream. \n",
